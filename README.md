# Restaurant Reviews: Stage 1
---

## Project Overview: Stage 1

 **Restaurant Reviews**  is a project from Udacity course - "Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program".

### Specification

I have been provided [the code](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) for a restaurant reviews website with a lot of issues. I had to convert the provided site and use a responsive design. 
- all responsiveness I've done with CSS,
- I created a responsive grid-based layout using CSS,
- I used media queries to provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes,
- I implemented accessibility features in the site HTML.
- I added a ServiceWorker.


### How to run the Restaurant App

1. Download or clone the repository.

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, open your browser and visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
